Description: minimize caching effects
 The nocache tool tries to minimize the effect an application has on
 the Linux file system cache. This is done by intercepting the open
 and close system calls and calling posix_fadvise with the
 POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED parameter. Because the library remembers which
 pages (ie., 4K-blocks of the file) were already in file system cache
 when the file was opened, these will not be marked as "don't need",
 because other applications might need that, although they are not
 actively used (think: hot standby). 
 .
 Use case: backup processes that should not interfere with the present
 state of the cache. <insert long description, indented with spaces>
